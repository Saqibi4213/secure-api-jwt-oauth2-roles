# Secure-Api-JWT-Outh2-Roles ðŸ“šðŸš€

## Description
This project is a RESTful API for a Bookstore built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It allows users to register, log in (using JWT or OAuth2), and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books. The API implements role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can modify the book data.

## Features
- **User Registration**: New users can sign up with a username, email, and password.
- **User Login**: Existing users can log in using their email and password or Google OAuth2.
- **Fetch All Books**: Retrieve a list of all available books.
- **Fetch a Single Book**: Get details of a specific book by its ID.
- **Create a New Book**: Admin users can add new books to the database.
- **Update a Book**: Admin users can modify details of an existing book.
- **Delete a Book**: Admin users can remove a book from the database.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized users can access certain endpoints.
